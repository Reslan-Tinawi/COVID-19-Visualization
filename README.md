# COVID-19-Visualization

This repository contains two notebooks created with `jupyter lab` for visualizing the COVID-19 data.

The notebooks are:

- `COVID-19 Reports Data`: this notebook contains visualization of the Reports data.

- `COVID-19 Time Series Data`: this notebook contains visualization of the Time Series data.

The visualizations are made with `plotly`, for running the jupyter lab, some packages need to be installed: [Plotly JupyterLab Support](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py#jupyterlab-support-python-35)

The following extensions were used in creating the notebooks:

- [jupyterlab-toc](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab-toc): A Table of Contents extension for JupyterLab.

- [Collapsible Headings](https://github.com/aquirdTurtle/Collapsible_Headings): Implements Collapsible Headers for Jupyter Lab Notebooks.
